# Math operators
Python has all the standard arithmetic operators such as addition `+`, 
subtraction `-`, multiplication `*`, division `/`, and exponents `**`. 

To quickly demonstrate these, let's define two variables `a` and `b` and 
execute some basic arithmetic operations

```python
a = 1
b = 10

a + b
a - b
a * b
a / b
b ** 2
```

!!! info "Dividing two `int` types returns a `float`"
    If you're familiar with languages like C or Python 2, you might be 
    surprised to discover that Python 3 returns a `float` even when you're 
    dividing two `ints`.

## Exercises
!!! tip "Exercise 1"
    Feel free to play around with types and arithmetic expressions on your own. 
    Define variables, run some operations, and even explore what happens if you 
    multiply e.g., a `str` with an `int`.
