# Math operators

Python has several mathematical operators for addition `+`, subtraction 
`-`, multiplication `*`, division `/`, and exponents `**`. To demonstrate 
these, let's define two variables `a` and `b`

```python
a = 1
b = 10
```

and run some basic expressions using the operators described above

```python
a + b
a - b
a * b
a / b
b ** 2
```

Not surprisingly `a + b = 11`, `a - b = -9`, `a * b = 10`, `a / b = 0.1`, and 
`b ** 2 = 100`. 

!!! info "Dividing two `int` types returns a `float` in Python 3"
    If you're familiar with other languages like C (or Python 2 for that matter) 
    you may notice that Python 3 conveniently returns a `float` even though 
    you're dividing two `ints`. 

## Exercises

!!! tip "Exercise 1"
    Feel free to play around with types and arithmetic expressions on your own. 
    Define some variables, run some arithmetic expressions, and try to explore 
    what happens if you multiply a `str` with an `int`. Python is full of 
    surprises.
