# Math operators

Python has fairly conventional mathematical operators for addition `+`, 
subtraction `-`, multiplication `*`, division `/`, and exponents `**`. 

To demonstrate these, let's define two variables `a` and `b` and execute some 
basic arithmetic operations

```python
a = 1
b = 10

a + b
a - b
a * b
a / b
b ** 2
```

!!! info "Dividing two `int` types returns a `float`"
    If you're familiar with languages like C or Python 2, you might be 
    surprised to find that Python 3 returns a `float` even when you 
    divide two `ints`. 

## Exercises

!!! tip "Exercise 1"
    Play around with types and arithmetic expressions on your own. Define 
    variables, run arithmetic expressions, and explore what happens if you 
    multiply e.g., a `str` with an `int`.
